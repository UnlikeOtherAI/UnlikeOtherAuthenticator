# AGENTS.md — Agent Onboarding

**If you are an AI agent, LLM, or automated contributor working on this repository, start here.**

---

## First Step — Always

Before doing any work, you **must** read the following file:

→ **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)**

`CLAUDE.md` is the source of truth for how to work with this repository. It contains project rules, constraints, and pointers to the full build brief.

---

## Required Reading Order

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — Project instructions and working rules
2. **`Docs/brief.md`** — Full build brief (the spec for what we're building)

Do not skip these. Do not skim. Read them in full before writing any code or making any decisions.

---

## Rules for Agents

- **Follow the brief.** All implementation must align with `Docs/brief.md`. It is the single source of truth for the product.
- **Follow the working rules.** `CLAUDE.md` defines how to behave in this repo.
- **Don't assume.** If something isn't specified, ask. Don't invent features or fill gaps with guesses.
- **Don't delete.** Never remove content from documentation unless explicitly told to.
- **Don't over-engineer.** Build exactly what's specified, nothing more.
- **Raise conflicts.** If you find a contradiction between files, flag it immediately rather than silently resolving it.
